How to install SuperFunChart
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Python stuff
=============

Do this to pull in the python dependencies::

    $ python setup.py develop

You should probably do this in a virtual environment.

Database
========

You also need a database.  I only use postgresql, but you can probably
get away with using MySQL or SQLite or whatever else you want.

Run the create-database-schema.sql file against whatever database you
go with.


Fire it up
==========

Start up the web server like this::

    $ gunicorn superfunchart:make_app\('"'scratch-matt.yaml'"'\)

Of course you need to replace scratch-matt.yaml with your own yaml
config file.
